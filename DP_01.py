# 2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank
You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.

The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:

There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.
More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.

            if security[n-i-1] <= security[n-i]:
                right[n-i-1] = right[n-i] + 1
        return [i for i in range(time, n-time) if left[i] >= time and right[i] >= time]
